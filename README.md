# CS-innovation
Code for a project looking to model credit supply expansion over the business cycle.

## Data-Availability
The data are not yet available. In the future, I will create a Github page from which one may download the data.

## Data Sources
1. USPTO data come from [here](https://www.uspto.gov/ip-policy/economic-research/research-datasets/patent-assignment-dataset).
2. I download Census BDSGEO dataset from [here](https://data.census.gov/table?t=Business%20Dynamics&g=010XX00US$0400000). This
data is aggregated from a survey of firms at the Census.
3. [Beck, Levine and Levkov](https://www.jstor.org/stable/40864982) (2010) have made their data available online. That data can be found [here](https://dataverse.nl/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=hdl:10411/15996). This is where the indicators for interstate and intrastate deregulation come from.
